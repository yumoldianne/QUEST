#Routing Algorithm
st.subheader("Flood Evacuation Routing Algorithm")

st.write("""
        Under the hood: we load flood polygons (EPSG:32651), create a smart grid over the affected area, assign per-node risk with batched spatial joins, then build a graph connecting neighboring grid points. Each edge gets a distance and a risk-weighted cost. For routing we run A* with a Euclidean heuristic. A single slider controls the risk penalty factor: 1.0 = fastest, >1 = progressively safer routes. This is soft avoidance â€” we penalize risky edges instead of forbidding them, which keeps routes feasible while prioritizing safety.

#Accessibility Hueristic
st.subheader("Relief Centers Accessibility Hueristic")

st.write("""
        We measure accessibility around each relief center by buffering the center (default 200 m), seeing how much of that buffer overlaps high-risk flood polygons (Var == 3), and converting that overlap fraction into an accessibility score: accessibility = max(0, 1 âˆ’ (area_of_high_risk_within_buffer / buffer_area))

        Therefore, a score of 1.0 = fully accessible (no high-risk area in the buffer) while a score of 0.0 = fully surrounded by high risk.
